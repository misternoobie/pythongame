# pythongame
Just some beginner space invaders ripoff; modified a tutorial and used my own class called character instead of an array of variables.
This is not yet optimized. I will need to put all the functions and class on a separate file and just import it to the main
knife variable will be replaced and will have a new class/object for it
You need to have the library called pygame
