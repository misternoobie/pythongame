# pythongame
Just some beginner space invaders ripoff; based from freecodecamp but i heavily modified the code and used my own class called character instead of an array of variables. Images were not included to avoid copyright. some variables methods are on a different file.
This is not yet optimized. Different approach were also used
You need to have the library called pygame
I used pycharm IDE

Future development: improve AI, make the code more modular, main menu, weapon select, stage 2
